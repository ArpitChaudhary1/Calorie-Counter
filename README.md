## 🚀 About the Project

This project takes an image of a food item as input and attempts to recognize the food type using basic image processing techniques. Once identified, the program estimates the calorie content based on predefined calorie values for common food items.

It showcases the use of image handling, condition-based calorie lookup, and user-friendly prompts in Python.
