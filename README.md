# 🍏 Calorie Counter (Python)

A Python-based tool that uses food image recognition to estimate the number of calories in the food item. It combines basic computer vision with calorie estimation to provide a simple, interactive user experience.

## 🚀 About the Project

This project takes an image of a food item as input and attempts to recognize the food type using basic image processing techniques. Once identified, the program estimates the calorie content based on predefined calorie values for common food items.

It showcases the use of image handling, condition-based calorie lookup, and user-friendly prompts in Python.

## 🧠 Features

- Accepts food image input (e.g., `apple.jpg`)
- Recognizes the food type based on the image
- Estimates and displays the approximate calorie count
- Simple and interactive command-line interface

---
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Image handling with PIL or OpenCV (if used)
- File input/output
- Conditional logic for food recognition
- Static dataset for calorie estimation

✅ Future Improvements
---

Use a larger food dataset for better recognition accuracy

Build a calorie database using an API like Edamam or CalorieNinjas

Create a user-friendly GUI with Tkinter or Streamlit
